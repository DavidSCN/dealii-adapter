Coupled structural solver written with the C++ finite element library deal.II. The coupled codes build on different deal.II tutorials:
The linear-elastic solver is based on the step-8 tutorial, the nonlinear solver builds on previous work of Jean-Paul Pelteret and Andrew McBride in their deal.II code gallery program 'Quasi-Static Finite-Strain Compressible Elasticity.' Documentation for usage and application can be found in the source code, on the deal.II tutorial documentation and the dealii-adapter wiki pages.
